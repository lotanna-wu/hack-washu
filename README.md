## Setup Instructions

Hi
In order for this to work on your end you have to have python install on your computer

if you have python(and pip) you can do

1. pip install pygame
2. pip install opencv-python
3. pip install mediapipe

in the terminal, to install the neccesary libraries
once thats done, run the game.py file

if the libraries have issues installing(especially mediapipe for some reason) youre just gonna have to trust us when we say the code works
